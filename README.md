# 📊 Manufacturing Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **manufacturing performance** by tracking production quantity, rejection trends, and wastage percentages across employees, machines, and departments.  
The goal is to provide actionable insights that help management **detect inefficiencies, reduce wastage, and make data-driven decisions**.

## 🎯 Business Challenge
The manufacturing company **Axon** faced challenges in:
- Monitoring **production efficiency**  
- Tracking **rejection rates** (employee, machine, department-wise)  
- Measuring **wastage %** accurately  
- Identifying **problem areas** that increased costs and reduced productivity  

---

## 🛠 Our Approach
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - SQL queries to clean and transform raw data  
   - Excel for KPI calculations  

2. **KPI Identification**  
   - Manufactured Qty  
   - Rejected Qty  
   - Processed Qty  
   - Wastage %  
   - Employee-wise and Machine-wise rejection  

3. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Excel for initial analysis  
   - Tableau for advanced data storytelling  
   - Power BI for interactive dashboard with drill-down and trend analysis

## 📈 Dashboard Insights
- **Total Manufactured Qty** → 87M  
- **Rejected Qty** → 525K  
- **Processed Qty** → 86M  
- **Wastage %** → 0.61%  

### Drill-Down Highlights:
- Employee-wise rejection (top contributors identified)  
- Machine-wise rejection (e.g., MC025, MC049, MC126, etc.)  
- Operation-wise rejection summary  
- Department comparison (Woven vs Printed labels)  
- Manufacturing trends across fiscal dates
