## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **manufacturing performance** by tracking production quantity, rejection trends, and wastage percentages across employees, machines, and departments.  
The goal is to provide actionable insights that help management **detect inefficiencies, reduce wastage, and make data-driven decisions**.

## 🎯 Business Challenge
The manufacturing company **Axon** faced challenges in:
- Monitoring **production efficiency**  
- Tracking **rejection rates** (employee, machine, department-wise)  
- Measuring **wastage %** accurately  
- Identifying **problem areas** that increased costs and reduced productivity  

---

## 🛠 Our Approach
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - SQL queries to clean and transform raw data  
   - Excel for KPI calculations  

2. **KPI Identification**  
   - Manufactured Qty  
   - Rejected Qty  
   - Processed Qty  
   - Wastage %  
   - Employee-wise and Machine-wise rejection  

3. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Excel for initial analysis  
   - Tableau for advanced data storytelling  
   - Power BI for interactive dashboard with drill-down and trend analysis

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- **MySQL** – Sorting, querying, and extracting data  
- **Excel** – Data cleaning, transformation, KPI calculation  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards, drill-down analysis, trends  
- **Tableau** – Advanced data visualization and storytelling  

---

## 📈 Dashboard Insights
- **Total Manufactured Qty** → 87M  
- **Rejected Qty** → 525K  
- **Processed Qty** → 86M  
- **Wastage %** → 0.61%  

### Drill-Down Highlights:
- Employee-wise rejection (top contributors identified)  
- Machine-wise rejection (e.g., MC025, MC049, MC126, etc.)  
- Operation-wise rejection summary  
- Department comparison (Woven vs Printed labels)  
- Manufacturing trends across fiscal dates

## 🚀 Expected Outcomes
- Detect inefficiencies across employees, machines, and departments  
- Reduce wastage and rejection rates  
- Enable management to make **data-driven decisions**  
- Improve overall manufacturing efficiency
